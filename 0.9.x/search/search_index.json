POST /track?profile_less=true</p> <p>A profile-less event will not create a profile but will generate a session. The data sent to the server must include a session ID, which can be an existing session or a new one generated on the client-side. It's important to note that a profile-less event will not have a profile when it enters the workflow, and the profile field will be empty.</p> <p>Method 2: Direct <code>Endpoint Posting</code></p> <p>Another way to send a profile-less event is by posting it directly to the following endpoint:</p> <p>=&gt; POST /collect/EVENT-TYPE/SOURCE-ID</p> <p>Where: - EVENT-TYPE is the event type (e.g., coupon-received). - SOURCE-ID is the event source ID.</p> <p>In the body of the query, send a standard JSON object, which becomes the event's properties. This method does not create a session by default, but you can add a profile and session during event processing for dynamic linkage within the workflow.</p> <p>Available Webhooks :</p> <p>Below are the available webhooks in this system:</p> <ol> <li> <p>POST <code>/track</code>: This endpoint is used for tracking events using a POST request.

It can create profile-less events with the provided properties.</p> </li> <li> <p>GET <code>/collect/EVENT-TYPE/SOURCE-ID</code>: Similar to the POST method, this endpoint collects data from a GET request with an event type and source ID. It can also create profile-less events based on query parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p>GET <code>/collect/EVENT-TYPE/SOURCE-ID</code>: This endpoint is used for collecting data from a GET request with an event type and source ID, potentially creating profile-less events.</p> </li> <li> <p>POST <code>/collect/EVENT-TYPE/SOURCE-ID</code>: Similar to the GET method, this endpoint collects data from a POST request with an event type and source ID.

While this is the simplest configuration, the main disadvantage of this setup is all of the requests you make will be sent to that specific coordination node. Since this puts a single node under stress, overall performance may be affected.</p> <p>One solution is to pass a static list of nodes to the client, so your requests will be equally distributed among the nodes.</p> <p>Or you can enable a feature called sniffing.</p> <p>With a static list of nodes, there\u2019s no guarantee that the nodes will always be up and running. For example, what happens if you take a node down to upgrade \u2014 or you add new nodes?</p> <p>If you enable sniffing, the client will start calling the <code>_nodes/_all/http</code> endpoint, and the response will be a list of all the nodes that are present in the cluster along with their IP addresses.

However, given that Tracardi, version prior 0.9.0, allocates approximately 100 indices per tenant, this limit can be reached rapidly as the number    of tenants grows. It necessitates adjustments to Elasticsearch configurations to accommodate a greater number of    indices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance Verification: It's crucial to rigorously test the system to ascertain its efficiency and reliability    under the strain of a multi-tenant arrangement (with exceeded 1000 indices). This ensures that the introduction of    more tenants doesn\u2019t compromise the performance of the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Anticipated Software Updates: The Tracardi development team is contemplating a migration of certain data types    from Elasticsearch to MySQL. This transition introduces a dependency on a MySQL database, which requires careful    integration and management alongside the existing Elasticsearch database. This should allow storing more tenant data    per one ES cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cluster Grouping: To further support a growing number of tenants, it is necessary to establish multiple Tracardi    clusters. Each of these clusters should be accessible through its own unique URL.

It must match the source ID that is defined in Tracardi.   Otherwise, the system will return an \"Unauthorized Access\" response.</li> <li>session.id - it is a UUID generated and saved on the client's side. Whenever the session changes or a new customer   visit starts, a new session ID is generated.</li> <li>profile.id - this is the UUID of the profile ID. The profile ID must remain unchanged during the entire customer   journey. The profile ID is generated on the server side. When the first event is sent to Tracardi, the system will   return a generated profile ID that needs to be saved by the client (browser or mobile device) and resent with each   subsequent event. Tracardi has several algorithms that try to keep the profile ID unchanged during the entire customer   journey. Some of those algorithms will be described below.</li> <li>context - this is a JSON data that describes the context of the event. It can be an agent type, e.g. mobile app   name, service name. This part is defined by the user.</li> <li>events - this is a collection of event objects called Event Payload, that consist of: type,   properties, context, time, tags, and options. See here for more details.</li> <li>options - this is a key-value store for additional options.</li> </ul> <p>Tracardi can collect several events in one request.

Workflow control when each action/node should be triggered. The action consists of an input, a program that computes the input data, and an output (the result of the program computation). In tracardi, an action can have one input and many outputs. In addition, the action has a configuration, it is a set of data that define how the program should behave, Let's assume that we want to connect to external resources of some database, it is in the configuration that we will have information about where this database is, and what username and password to use to connect to the resource.</p> <p>Due to the fact that Tracardi can have many outputs, we must somehow indicate on which output our data should appear. That's why Tracardi introduces concepts such as a port. Thanks to them, we can indicate where the data will be returned.

It is related to the JSON configuration in such a way that when filling in the form fields, we automatically fill/change the JSON object.</p> <p>The first way is available out-of-the-box. Developer defines the default JSON object when registering the plugin and this is it. This object will appear in the <code>set_up</code> method as a <code>config</code> parameter.</p> <p>So let's expand our plugin with configuration.</p>"},{"location":"plugins/tutorial/part2/#json-configuration","title":"JSON Configuration","text":"<p>In the register function, we add the following entry in the spec:</p> <pre><code>init = {\n    \"event_type\": \"\"  # (1)\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>We set up <code>event_type</code> as empty string.

In case of conflicting data, like different names, the system resolves the conflict by picking the last value and saving other values in an \"aux.conflict.name\" field, like [\"Bill\", \"William\"].</p> <p>The merged profile receives a new ID, and a new profile record is created. Obsolete profiles are deleted, and the events associated with the deleted profiles are copied to the new merged profile.</p> <p>The new profile ID is saved locally on the device's database using JavaScript.

The laptop's browser saves a reference to this new profile. However, the mobile phone still stores the reference to the old profile.</p> <p>The next time the customer uses their mobile phone to access the online store, the system uses the old profile ID to identify them. But instead of loading the old profile, the system recognizes that the old profile ID has been merged with a new profile. The mobile phone receives the new profile ID (3) and saves it locally.</p> <p>This way, the linked profile information propagates to all devices, and the customer will have the same updated profile ID on both the laptop and the mobile phone. This provides a complete customer view and improves the overall customer experience.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>It is very important to synchronize <code>profile.id</code> returned in response with the profile ID saved on a client side. If the profile in the response is different from the one sent, it means the client should update its <code>profile.id</code>  and send the new one with the next call.

A snapshot    repository is a location where Elasticsearch stores the backup data. It can be a shared file system, a cloud storage    service, or a network-attached storage (NAS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Snapshot Lifecycle: You define a snapshot lifecycle policy that specifies how often to take backups and how long    to retain them. This policy automates the backup process and ensures that backups are created at regular intervals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snapshot Creation: When a snapshot is created, Elasticsearch takes a point-in-time copy of the data and metadata    in the cluster. This includes index data, index settings, mappings, and other relevant information. The snapshot is    stored in the designated repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incremental Backups: Elasticsearch uses incremental backups, which means that subsequent snapshots only include    the changes since the last snapshot. This reduces the backup time and storage requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snapshot and Restore API: Elasticsearch provides a Snapshot and Restore API that allows you to manage the backup    process. You can create, list, restore, and delete snapshots using this API. You can also monitor the status of    snapshot operations and track the progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cluster Coordination: When taking snapshots, Elasticsearch coordinates the backup process across all nodes in the    cluster. It ensures that each shard of the data is captured and included in the backup, even in a distributed cluster    setup.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backup Verification: Elasticsearch allows you to verify the integrity of a snapshot by performing a verification    process. This ensures that the backup data is intact and can be restored successfully if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disaster Recovery: In the event of a disaster or data loss, you can restore a snapshot to recover your data.    Elasticsearch provides options to restore the entire cluster, specific indices, or individual shards from a snapshot.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Please read more about Elasticsearch (ES) backups in documentation.  </p>"},{"location":"qa/how_can_I_authorize_and_get_API_KEY/","title":"How can I authorize and get API KEY","text":"<p>To authorize and obtain an API key for Tracardi, you can use OAuth2 authorization.

Here's an overview of how live segmentation works:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Workflow Definition: Live segmentation starts with defining workflows, which outline the steps and logic for   segmenting profiles. These workflows specify the conditions, actions, and filters required to classify profiles into   segments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Profile Retrieval: The live segmentation system fetches the defined workflows. It then retrieves the profiles that   need to be segmented. Profiles typically contain user data, such as demographics, preferences, behaviors, and   interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iteration and Execution: The system iterates over each profile and executes the defined workflow for that profile.   This means that the segmentation logic is applied to each individual profile to determine its segment membership.</p> </li> <li> <p>Task Queuing: To efficiently manage the segmentation tasks, a pool of segmentations is created. Each segmentation task   is queued in a Redis queue, which acts as a job queue system. The queue holds the tasks until a worker is available to   process them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Segmentation Job Docker: The segmentation job docker container, named \"tracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-job\", is   responsible for orchestrating the segmentation tasks. It picks up all workflows, batches profiles and schedules them   for processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Segmentation Worker Docker: The segmentation worker docker container, named \"   tracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-worker\" performs the actual segmentation computations. When a worker receives a   task from the job docker, it applies the workflow logic to the corresponding profile, determines the segment(s) the   profile belongs to, and stores the segmentation results in profile. This way segmentation can run in parallel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Result Storage: After a worker finishes segmenting a profile, it stores the segmentation results in profile in key segments. </p> </li> <li> <p>Cron Job: Live segmentation is often scheduled as a recurring task using a cron job. The cron job triggers the   segmentation process at specified intervals, ensuring that profiles are regularly segmented based on the defined   workflows. Docker tracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-job is responsible for this.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, live segmentation involves defining workflows, retrieving profiles, queuing segmentation tasks, and executing the tasks using dedicated job and worker docker containers.

Make sure all the necessary data properties\nmatch the right parts of Tracardi. Once this is done, send it to Elasticsearch using your preferred programming\nlanguage.\n\n## Importing CSV Data to Elasticsearch using Python\n\nIn this chapter we explain how to use Python to iterate through a CSV file containing fields such\nas `first name`, `last name`, and `gender` and import this data into an Elasticsearch index. The Elasticsearch index\nshould follow the provided schema structure.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n- Elasticsearch server up and running.\n- Python installed on your system.\n- Elasticsearch Python client library (`elasticsearch-py`) installed.\n\n\n## Necessary Information\n\nTo perform the data import to Tracardi, please ensure you have the following essential details:\n\n1. **Elasticsearch Login and Password:**\n   You will require the login credentials (username and password) for the Elasticsearch instance that is connected to\n   Tracardi. If necessary, make modifications to the script provided below to include these login credentials.\n\n2. **Last Event Index Name:**\n   You will need to know the name of the most recent monthly event index created by Tracardi in Elasticsearch. Please\n   check your Elasticsearch environment to determine the name of this index.\n\n3. **Import Sequence:**\n   The data import should follow a specific sequence to ensure proper data handling. Start by importing profiles, and\n   subsequently, if required, import events and sessions. This order ensures that the essential profile data is in place\n   before related events and sessions are imported.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. **Install the Elasticsearch Python Client**\n\n   If you haven't already installed the Elasticsearch Python client, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install elasticsearch\n   ```\n\n2. **Python Script for Data Import**\n\n   Create a Python script that reads the CSV file, maps its data to the Elasticsearch schema, and sends the data to the\n   Elasticsearch index. Here's a sample Python script to achieve this:\n\n   ```python\n   from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n   import csv\n   import uuid\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   # Elasticsearch client setup\n   es = Elasticsearch([{'host': 'your_elasticsearch_host', 'port': 9200}])\n\n   # Open the CSV file\n   with open('your_data.csv', mode='r') as csv_file:\n       csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)\n\n       # Iterate through each row in the CSV\n       for row in csv_reader:\n           # Create a unique identifier for each record\n           unique_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\n           # Prepare the data in the Elasticsearch schema\n           data = {\n               \"id\": unique_id,\n               \"ids\": [unique_id],\n               \"metadata\": {\n                   \"time\": {\n                       \"insert\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n                       \"create\": None,\n                       \"update\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n                       \"segmentation\": None,\n                       \"visit\": {\n                           \"last\": None,\n                           \"current\": datetime.now().isoformat(),\n                           \"count\": 1,\n                           \"tz\": \"Your_Timezone\"\n                       }\n                   },\n                   \"aux\": {},\n                   \"status\": None\n               },\n               \"stats\": {\n                   \"visits\": 0,\n                   \"views\": 0,\n                   \"counters\": {}\n               },\n               \"traits\": {\n                   \"gender\": row['gender']\n               },\n               \"segments\": [],\n               \"interests\": {},\n               \"consents\": {\n                   \"cookies\": {\n                       \"revoke\": None\n                   }\n               },\n               \"active\": True,\n               \"aux\": {\n                   \"geo\": {\n                       \"continent\": \"Your_Continent\"\n                   }\n               },\n               \"data\": {\n                   \"pii\": {\n                       \"firstname\": row['first name'],\n                       \"lastname\": row['last name'],\n                       \"name\": row['first name'] + \" \" + row['last name']\n                   },\n                   # Add other data fields as needed\n               }\n           }\n\n           # Send the data to Elasticsearch\n           print(es.index(index='vendor.tracardi-event-2023-10', doc_type='_doc', body=data))\n\n   print(\"Data import completed.\")\n   ```\n\n   Replace placeholders like `'your_elasticsearch_host'`, `'your_data.csv'`, `'Your_Timezone'`, and other values with\n   your specific details. Notice that the import is to the monthly index of the tracardi event `vendor.tracardi-event-2023-10`. Please check elasticsearch for the last monthly index that is created by tracardi. \n\n3. **Run the Python Script**\n\n   Execute the Python script to import the data from the CSV file into your Elasticsearch index. You should see the \"\n   Data import completed\" message upon successful execution.\n\nNow, your CSV data is successfully imported into Elasticsearch with the specified schema.\n\n### How to import event data through Tracardi endpoint?\n\nYou can use `/track` endpoint to import event data from CSV and map them with session and profile.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport requests\n\n\ndef read_csv(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        reader = csv.reader(file)\n        headers = next(reader)  # Read the header row\n        for row in reader:  # Iterate over the remaining rows\n            yield dict(zip(headers, row))  # spit out column name and data\n\n\n# Provide the path to your CSV file\nconfig = ('file1.csv', 'phone-call', 'session-id', 'profile-id')\n\nsource_id = \"c437d599-5d38-43e2-84b9-c6267dce6410\"\n\nfor row in read_csv(config[0]):\n\n    mapped_properties = {\n       \"from\": config[0]\n       # Add the properties you need. Include them in the CSV to be able to \n       # map them here\n    }\n\n    payload = {\n        \"source\": {\n            \"id\": source_id\n        },\n        \"session\": {\n            \"id\": row[config[2]]  # If the session id does not exist system will create it for you\n        },\n        \"profile\": {\n            \"id\": row[config[3]]\n        },\n        \"events\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": config[1],\n                \"properties\": row\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\n    response = requests.post(url=\"http://localhost:8686/track\", json=payload)\n\n    # Display response\n    print(response.content)\n</code></pre> <p>This document also answers the questions: - How to programmatically import data to Tracardi? - Is there a way to use code to import data to Tracardi? - How to use API to import data?</p>"},{"location":"qa/how_to_import_initial_data/","title":"How to make the initial loading of the data and how to update it constantly?

A webhook sends an API call when an event occurs in an external system, such as Slack notifying when someone joins a channel or writes a message. Intercepting a webhook is simple - create a URL webhook in Tracardi and add it to the external system as the URL to send data when an event occurs. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that the external system lacks information about the user who raised the event. Each external system has its own method of user identification, which means the profile ID in the external system is different from Tracardi's.</p> <p>This discrepancy means that when data is sent, the external system may not send it in any globally defined way. As a result, it is not possible to create a Tracardi event associated with any profile. Such events are profile-less, and unfortunately, do not contain information useful for tracking customer journeys.

Tracardi can store multiple profiles belonging to one person, so if there is a technical possibility to connect them, it will do so.

This identifier is used to group events and connect each event to one profile.</p> <p>Once we have grouped events, we can consider whether there is any data that allows us to merge the profile from the external system with the profile from Tracardi. For this purpose, we use identification points and some data that  identifies the profile across all systems.

UTM parameters are a standard way of tagging URLs to track the source, medium, and campaign of traffic. When a user clicks on a URL with UTM parameters, the parameters are appended to the URL and can be captured by Tracardi.</p> <p>Here are some of the ways Tracardi can use UTM parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Identify the source of traffic: Tracardi can use the <code>utm_source</code> parameter to identify the source of traffic,   such as a social media platform, email newsletter, or paid advertising campaign.</li> <li>Identify the medium of traffic: Tracardi can use the <code>utm_medium</code> parameter to identify the medium of traffic,   such as a website, email, or social media post.</li> <li>Identify the campaign: Tracardi can use the <code>utm_campaign</code> parameter to identify the specific marketing campaign   that generated the traffic.</li> <li>Track campaign performance: Tracardi can use UTM parameters to track the performance of marketing campaigns by   measuring metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and revenue generated.</li> </ul> <p>To use UTM parameters with Tracardi, you can simply add them to the URLs that you are using to track your marketing campaigns. For example, the following URL includes UTM parameters for a Facebook ad campaign:</p> <pre><code>https://www.example.com/product?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=summer-sale\n</code></pre> <p>When a user clicks on a URL with UTM parameters, Tracardi captures those parameters and associates them with the user's session. This means that even if the user subsequently clicks on URLs without UTM parameters, their interactions will still be attributed to the original UTM source. This is because Tracardi maintains the UTM parameters throughout the user's session.</p> <p>Overall, UTM parameters are a powerful tool that can be used to track marketing campaigns and gain valuable insights into their performance. Tracardi can effectively use UTM parameters to track traffic, identify sources and mediums, measure campaign performance, and optimize marketing efforts.</p>"},{"location":"qa/how_tracardi_is_upgraded/","title":"How Tracardi is upgraded?","text":"<p>Tracardi upgrades are categorized into two types: minor upgrades and major upgrades.</p> <p>Minor Upgrades: Minor upgrades do not involve any changes in the underlying database structure. These upgrades are indicated by a change in the last number of the version. For example, upgrading from version 0.8.1.x to version 0.8.1.y would be considered a minor upgrade. Minor upgrades do not require data migration and can be performed simply by upgrading the Docker tag to the new version. The system will continue to work as it did before the upgrade.</p> <p>Major Upgrades: Major upgrades, on the other hand, involve changes in the database structure. These upgrades are indicated by a change in a number other than the last one in the version. For example, upgrading from version 0.8.0 to version 0.8.1 would be considered a major upgrade. Major upgrades typically require data migration or data schema updates. In Tracardi, data migration is performed using Elasticsearch's reindexing process. This involves running two copies of the system with separate sets of indices: one with the old version and one with the new version. Once the migration is complete, the Docker tag can be upgraded, and the system will automatically switch to the new version. After a period of time, the old version's data can be safely deleted.</p> <p>Tracardi provides migration scripts for all major versions, allowing for smooth upgrades. However, it's important to note that these scripts are only available from one version to the next. Skipping versions is not supported, and custom scripts may require additional effort and commercial services. It is recommended to follow the upgrade path version by version to ensure proper data migration and system stability.</p> <p>If you are running a multi-tenant instance of Tracardi, the upgrade process will be applied to all tenants simultaneously. This means that when performing an upgrade, the changes will be applied uniformly across all the tenants in the system.</p> <p>In the case of a major upgrade, where data structure changes are involved, it is important to note that the migration process will require migrating the data for all tenants. This ensures that the entire system is up-to-date and consistent with the new version. The data migration process, must be performed for all tenants to ensure that their data aligns with the updated database structure.</p> <p>By applying the major upgrade to all tenants and performing the necessary data migration, the system can maintain data integrity.</p>"},{"location":"qa/how_tracardi_loads_profile/","title":"How tracardi loads profile","text":"<p>Tracardi utilizes ID to identify profiles, with each profile having a unique identifier. When there is only one profile per user, loading is performed through a simple query that matches the ID to the given ID. However, since Tracardi gathers data from multiple sources and channels, passing the product ID to each of them may not always be feasible. Hence, during the initial data collection phase when the user is anonymous, multiple profiles belonging to the same user are stored in Tracardi. When linking profiles, all profile IDs are copied to the <code>IDS</code> field, and loading is executed by checking whether the given ID corresponds to any of the IDs stored in the <code>ids</code> field. Despite having an <code>ID</code> field, the possibility of outdated IDs on certain devices necessitates the use of the <code>ids</code> field during loading. This approach enables Tracardi to merge profiles from external systems by simply adding the external system's profile ID to the <code>ids</code> field, which can then be used to load the profile.</p> Example of profile data<pre><code>{\n  \"id\": \"22082393-4b65-4add-a2e1-7a6982a79d0d\",\n  \"ids\": [\n    \"22082393-4b65-4add-a2e1-7a6982a79d0d\",\n    \"79d07a66-a2e1-4a44-5b65-22082393a2e1\"\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"qa/how_tracardi_records_vistits/","title":"How tracardi calculate the visits","text":"<p>Tracardi calculates visits based on the concept of a session. A session is identified by a session ID, which is typically a randomly generated number such as a UUID4. The session ID is used to track a user's activity and determine the duration of their visit.</p> <p>Tracardi calculates visits based on the continuity of the session ID. As long as the session ID remains the same, Tracardi considers it to be part of the same visit.</p> <p>Let's consider an example with 10 events. The first three events have a session ID of 1, the next five events have a session ID of 2, and the remaining events have a session ID of 3. In this case, Tracardi would interpret this as three separate visits because there are three distinct session IDs.</p> <p>However, it is also possible to append events to a previous visit by sending them with the same session ID as before. This allows for the extension of a visit beyond the initial set of events.</p> <p>In the case of web data collection, Tracardi relies on the session ID stored in a cookie. When a user opens a web page, Tracardi's JavaScript code creates a session and saves the session ID in a cookie. As long as the user continues browsing the website without closing their browser, the same session ID is used and associated with each event generated by the user's actions. Tracardi considers this continuous stream of events with the same session ID as a single visit. If the user closes their browser, the cookie is deleted, indicating the end of the session. When the user visits the website again, a new session ID is generated, and a new visit begins.</p> <p>For data collected from other sources, such as mobile apps, the definition of a visit may vary. In the mobile app context, a visit can start when the user opens the app and ends when the user closes it. To track visits in this scenario, the mobile app needs to generate a session ID when the app starts and include the same session ID in every event sent to Tracardi. Tracardi monitors session changes and increments the visit counter accordingly.</p> <p>In cases where data is collected from an external system or data source where we are not so sure when session starts or ends, developers can define a session based on the data that exists in the external system. For example, they can use a visit ID or device ID as a session identifier. If no specific identifier is available, developers can define a session as a fixed time period, such as 15 minutes, 10 events, etc. or choose to include all events in one session. Then generate one UUID4 session ID and keep it the same for all events.</p> <p>Overall, Tracardi allows developers to define how long a visit lasts by controlling the session ID and determining when to start and end a session based on the specific data source, whether it's a web page or a mobile app.</p>"},{"location":"qa/how_tracardi_resolves_location/","title":"How Tracardi Resolves Location","text":"<p>Tracardi resolves location based on the IP address of the user.

The tracker payload basically consists of data in    the form of profile, session, and event payloads. There may be multiple event payloads for a single profile, with    potentially as many as 100 events per profile. This illustrates how data is bulked together.</p> </li> <li> <p>The data is then preprocessed and split into events, profiles, and sessions within the system. It is subsequently    sent to the workflow for processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the workflow, an internal state is maintained, including the event, profile, and session data. The result of    the workflow, along with any modifications to the event, profile, and session, is saved into the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, the event or profile is sent to a destination via outbound traffic, and a response is generated. This    process operates as a single work unit, requiring completion before a response is issued. Consequently, if a workflow    takes a long time to process, it can result in extended processing times.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Pros of this approach:</p> <ul> <li>Easy setup with just one Docker installation.</li> <li>Ability to add personalized content and await responses within the workflow.</li> <li>Simplified maintenance of both the system and the code.</li> </ul> <p>Cons of this approach:</p> <ul> <li>Limited scalability as everything must be scaled together.</li> <li>Limited data access as data can only be fetched from the database.</li> <li>Lack of easy extensibility for specific components, as extensions often pollute the code.</li> <li>Lower performance due to increased processing time as more elements are added to the workflow or outbound traffic.</li> </ul> <p>There is also a commercial version with a different approach:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the commercial version, there is a foreground process in the server and a background process. The request and    tracker payload, including profile and event payloads, are processed similarly.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, in this version, the user does not need to wait for everything to complete. The preprocessed data is    provided quickly as a response.</p> </li> <li> <p>The result of preprocessing includes event, profile, and session data. Deltas are used to describe how the profile is    updated.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the background, event, profile, and session data are created and sent to a workflow stream. This stream, which    utilizes Apache Pulsar, stores the data and connects to a worker for processing. Additional workers can be added as    needed, allowing for scalable processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The output of this processing goes to a collector, which aggregates and outputs profile and session information at    regular intervals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Computed profiles and sessions are sent to their respective streams, where they can be connected to additional code    for further processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Events, which are immutable, are sent directly to the event stream and then to the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another important component is responsible for determining when it's appropriate to process data, ensuring that    metrics are computed efficiently, and sending profile data to external systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>This approach optimizes data processing, reducing stress on both the database and external systems.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, the commercial version offers faster responses by separating foreground and background processing, as well as improved scalability and flexibility in handling data streams. It provides better performance and reduces stress on the database and external systems. Additionally, failures in various components can be handled more effectively.</p>"},{"location":"qa/what_are_the_main_featuress_of_commercial_version/","title":"What are the main features of commercial vs open-source version?","text":"Feature Open source Commercial Data collection * API bridge x x * Redirect bridge x * Maintaining the profile id between domains x * Kafka bridge x * MQTT Bridge x Data mapping * Event to profile mappings x x * Event validation x * Event reshaping x * Event remapping x Profile identification * Profile merging x x * Profile identification points x * Data compliance x * Profile consents x x Data storage * Events x x * Sessions x x * Profiles x x * Entities x Destinations * Event destinations x * Profile destinations x Workflow triggers * Workflow triggered by event x x * Workflow triggered by time x * Workflow triggered by segmentation x * Workflow skipped if no consent x Segmentation * Simple segmentation based on profile data x x * Segmentation based on event data x * Segmentation by workflow x Profile data enhancement * Profile metrics x * Auto profile geo location x Automation * Workflow automation x x * Standard automation actions x x * Time based automation x * AI features, vector stores x * Geo location features x * Automation based on event aggregations x * UIX widgets x * Interactions with Twilio, varius databases, etc x Other * Multi-tenancy x * Performance improvements x * Automatic profile visits closing x * Post collection data indexing x"},{"location":"qa/what_are_the_plugins/","title":"What are plugins","text":"<p>Plugins in Tracardi are modular components that extend the functionality of the platform.

When this link is clicked, it triggers a specific event in Tracardi and redirects the user to a designated URL.</p> <p>How It Works:</p> <p>You can generate an event redirect link in the following format:</p> <pre><code>http://api.tracardi.com/redirect/{redirect-identifier}/{optional-session-id}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>{redirect-identifier}</code>: A unique identifier for the redirect you want to trigger.</li> <li><code>{optional-session-id}</code>: An optional session identifier that can be attached to the link.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>Let's break down an example to illustrate how event redirects work:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You create a link like this:   <pre><code>http://api.tracardi.com/redirect/d81c184a-eb5d-4f9e-b0f0-4b62bf7066dd/{optional-session-id}\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>When a customer clicks the above link, they will be redirected to (this is defined by user):   <pre><code>https://join.slack.com/t/tracardi/shared_invite/abcd\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Simultaneously, a \"slack-invite-link\" event will be registered in Tracardi, including the specified properties.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Session-ID Attachment:</p> <p>You have the option to attach a session identifier to the link. Here's why you might want to do that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you're working with a specific user profile and have their session ID, attaching it to the link ensures that the   event triggered by the link is automatically associated with that profile and its current session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tracardi profiles can be loaded using either their profile ID or one of their session ID. So, if you're running a workflow for a   particular profile and want to send an email with a link that, when clicked, registers an event in Tracardi, attach   the session ID. This way, the click event will be seamlessly linked to the profile and its ongoing session.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In essence, event redirects offer a straightforward way to capture user interactions, trigger events, and maintain associations with user profiles and sessions in Tracardi.</p>"},{"location":"qa/what_is_event_source/","title":"What is event source?","text":"<p>Event source refers to incoming traffic, which consists of systems that are capable of sending data to Tracardi. These systems can include websites, internal systems, and various services. Tracardi identifies and logs this inbound traffic, assigning it a unique identifier to track its origin and behavior.</p> <p>An event source serves as a bridge between the external system and Tracardi. It collects data from a specific source, such as a queue, email, or social media, and transfers it to Tracardi for further processing. For instance, Tracardi can use an API bridge to collect data from an API's \"/track\" endpoint and bring it into the system. Depending on the version of Tracardi being used, there may be different types of bridges, such as a Kafka bridge, designed to collect data from a Kafka message broker.</p> <p>When setting up a new project with Tracardi, it is essential to create a new event source. This event source provides an identifier that can be attached to track calls, enabling the collection of data about users. However, it's worth noting that an event source can be configured as ephemeral, meaning the data received through this type of event source is not stored permanently in the system. Instead, it is used and processed by the workflow in real-time, without the need for long-term storage.</p> <p>Important to consider is that certain sources may require user consent before collecting and storing their data. For example, a web page might need user consent to gather and retain their data for processing.</p>"},{"location":"qa/what_is_event_tag/","title":"What is event tag?","text":"<p>An event tag is a label or identifier that is associated with a specific event to categorize and organize it based on certain attributes or characteristics.

They offer a way to group events together based on common properties, facilitating better organization and management of event data.</p> <p>For example, in Tracardi, events related to product purchases could be tagged with labels like \" purchase,\" \"transaction,\" or \"completed order.\" Some events in Tracardi are automatically tagged to create a customer journey map, providing a visual representation of how customers engage over time.</p>"},{"location":"qa/what_is_major_version_upgrade/","title":"What is major version upgrade?","text":"<p>A major version upgrade refers to a significant update or release of a software system that introduces substantial changes, including modifications to the underlying database structure.</p> <p>In the context of Tracardi, a major version upgrade is indicated by a change in a number other than the last one in the version. For example, upgrading from version 0.8.0 to version 0.8.1 would be considered a major upgrade.</p> <p>During a major version upgrade of Tracardi, there may be changes to the database schema or data structure. These changes often require data migration or data schema updates to ensure that the system functions properly with the new version. Tracardi handles data migration during major upgrades using Elasticsearch's reindexing process.</p> <p>The upgrade process typically involves running two copies of the system: one with the old version and one with the new version. The migration process moves the data from the old version to the new version while ensuring data integrity and consistency. Once the migration is complete, the Docker tag can be upgraded, and the system will automatically switch to the new version.</p> <p>It's important to note that major upgrades may require additional effort and planning compared to minor upgrades. Tracardi provides migration scripts for all major versions, which help facilitate the upgrade process and ensure proper data migration.

Segmentation involves dividing your market into subsets based on criteria like    demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics (interests, values, lifestyle), behavior (purchase history,    product usage), or geography. The purpose of segmentation in marketing automation is to target these groups with    tailored messages or offers that are more likely to resonate with them. For example, you might have a segment of    customers who have previously purchased a specific product and you want to target them with a promotional offer for a    related product.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audience: An audience, on the other hand, can be thought of as the larger group of people you are trying to reach    with your marketing efforts. This could include your current customers, potential customers, and other stakeholders.    In marketing automation, the term \"audience\" is often used more broadly and can encompass multiple segments. It's    about the total group of people who will be exposed to your marketing campaign. For instance, your audience for a    digital ad campaign could include several different segments, such as new customers, returning customers, and    prospects who have engaged with your content but haven't made a purchase.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Segmentation has a dynamic nature. That means that individuals can move from one segment to another over time. This dynamism is a critical aspect of segmentation and is based on changes in customer behavior, preferences, or other defining characteristics. Here's how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Behavioral Changes: Customers' behaviors can change due to various factors such as life events, changing    interests, or evolving needs. For instance, a customer who was in a segment characterized by infrequent purchases    might start buying more regularly, thus moving to a segment of frequent buyers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Updates: As new data is collected, the profiles of customers get updated. This continuous influx of data can    lead to customers being reclassified into different segments. For example, updating demographic information like age    or income can shift a customer into a new segment more aligned with their current status.</p> </li> <li> <p>Engagement Levels: A change in how customers interact with your brand can also trigger a shift in segments. For    example, a customer who increases their engagement with your digital content or marketing emails might move into a    segment characterized by higher engagement levels.</p> </li> <li> <p>Purchase History: Changes in purchasing behavior, such as the types of products bought or the frequency of    purchases, can result in movement between segments. For instance, a customer might move from a \"one-time purchaser\"    segment to a \"repeat customer\" segment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automated Re-segmentation: Many marketing automation systems are designed to automatically re-segment customers    based on predefined rules or machine learning algorithms. This automation ensures that segments are always up-to-date    and reflective of the latest customer data and behaviors.</p> </li> </ol> <p>From the technical point of view that means the segments are constantly re-evaluated, and a segment is just a tag that tells that some customer belongs to defined segment.</p> <p>In contrast to segments, audiences in the context of marketing automation and data management are generally more static and purpose-specific. Unlike segments, which are continuously updated based on ongoing data collection, time passing, and behavioral changes, audiences are typically created for a specific purpose as a data query at a specific point in time. Here's a detailed look at the audience properties:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Purpose-Specific Creation: An audience is often created for a particular marketing campaign or business    initiative. This means that the data used to define an audience is queried and compiled to meet the specific    requirements of that campaign or initiative. Once the audience is defined, it does not automatically update customer    tags or change    unless manually revised for a new purpose, or when data is queried again.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of Automatic Re-evaluation: In contrast to segments that are often re-evaluated and updated automatically as    new data comes in, audiences do not undergo this automatic re-evaluation. The data set for an audience reflects the    criteria and information available at the time of its creation. Basically the audience is the information on how to    query data to compose the required set of customers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Targeted for Specific Campaigns: Audiences are often used for specific, time-bound marketing campaigns, events,    or promotions. For example, an audience might be created for a holiday season marketing campaign, using data relevant    to that particular time period and campaign objective. Audiences are used for customer activation using external    systems. Once sent to external system then stay the ave and do not evolve.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manual Intervention for Updates: If there is a need to update an audience in the external system, such as    including more recent customer data or adjusting the criteria, this usually requires manual intervention. The    marketer would need to re-query the database to create an updated audience.

It doesn't immediately write them to a database but instead buffers them for a certain period or until a specified condition is met. This approach is often used to optimize data storage and minimize the number of database writes.</p> <p>After accumulating a set of changes or when a predefined interval or condition is met, the Flusher worker then \"flushes\" or writes these changes to the appropriate data storage, such as a database. This batching of changes helps reduce the overhead of frequent database writes, resulting in more efficient and optimized data storage operations.</p> <p>The Flusher worker is particularly important in scenarios where there are many frequent updates to data, and it helps manage and streamline the process of persisting those updates in a way that is both efficient and practical for the system.</p>"},{"location":"qa/what_is_tracardi_worker_responsible_for/","title":"What does the open source Tracardi worker do?","text":"<p>Just like other Tracardi workers, the open source Tracardi worker handles tasks that run in the background.

Queues effectively manage surges in traffic, ensuring smooth event processing and preventing system    overload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Payload Size:    Assess the average size of event payloads. Larger payloads require more resources and may result in slower processing    compared to smaller events. Optimize event payloads by eliminating unnecessary data to enhance performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Storage and Retention:    Consider the number of events stored per day and its impact on other processes, such as segmentation. Determine the    desired data retention period, as longer retention increases query size and segmentation complexity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Index Granularity and Data Partitioning:    Decide how to partition event data into indices. Default quarterly indices create four indices per year, while    monthly splits require more indices and may impact query performance. Monthly splits offer more granular data storage    and archiving.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Volume and Segmentation:    Evaluate the number of customers that Tracardi will handle.

To perform segmentation, you need a profile, which is identified by a unique profile ID in Tracardi. There are different ways to do segmentation.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Real-time Segmentation: This method involves categorizing customers in real time based on specific events or actions    they take. For example, when a customer answers an email or visits a page a certain number of times, their profile is    automatically moved to a particular segment. Tracardi provides actions like \"add segment\" or \"delete segment\" in    workflows to perform real-time segmentation based on defined conditions real-time when the data changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time-triggered Segmentation: This method starts the segmentation process based on the absence of certain events or    actions. For instance, if a customer hasn't made a purchase or visited your page for a specified period, a    time-triggered segmentation process is initiated. Tracardi runs this process periodically, such as every hour, to    check if the defined condition is met.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ad hoc Segmentation: This method involves segmenting customers based on existing data. It includes selecting profiles    using available data, such as demographic information (age, shoe size, location), to create segments. While this    method is less sophisticated compared to the others, it can still be useful for filtering based on aggregated values    like the number of specific events or the most recent event type. However, adhoc segmentation is limited when it    comes to segmenting based on event sequences or external data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>At present, Tracardi exclusively provides first two segmentation methods. However, numerous scenarios that involve the third method can be accomplished by employing the first two methods or post event segmentation. For instance, when segmenting based on existing data such as gender, one can identify the event responsible for altering the gender and segment the profile in real-time as the data changes. This can be achieved by using post event segmentation or executing an if statement and utilizing the \"add segment\" action to assign the relevant segment to the profile in the workflow.</p>"},{"location":"qa/when_can_i_use_tracardi_for_free/","title":"When can I use Tracari for free?","text":"<p>Tracardi offers a free open-source version that allows individuals and small companies to use the system at no cost.</p> <p>However, if your intention is to create a software-as-a-service (SAAS) platform that involves selling or reselling Tracardi to customers, you would need to consider the commercial open-source version.

However, by extracting and manipulating the relevant data from the payload, users can integrate their desired session and profile details into webhook events seamlessly.</p>"},{"location":"qa/bulk/available_extensions_with_description/","title":"What extensions are in Tracardi ?","text":"<ul> <li>ActiveCampaign: Customer Experience Automation Platform for sending email campaigns, automating features, and managing contacts.</li> <li>Airtable: Cloud collaboration service with spreadsheet-database hybrid features for managing data.</li> <li>Amplitude: Cloud-based analytical system for better understanding of customer behavior.</li> <li>AWS IAM: AWS connector that opens Tracardi to AWS services.</li> <li>Civi CRM: Web-based suite for managing information about an organization's constituents, donors, members, and more.</li> <li>ElasticEmail: All-in-one email delivery platform with tools for managing contacts, templates, campaigns, and reports.</li> <li>ElasticSearch: Distributed, free, and open search and analytics engine for various types of data.</li> <li>Full contact: Cloud-based contact identity resolution platform for accurately identifying people and optimizing experiences.</li> <li>HubSpot: Integrated CRM platform with marketing, sales, service, operations, and website-building software.</li> <li>InfluxDB: Open-source time series database with APIs for storing, querying, processing, and visualizing data.</li> <li>Mailchimp MA: Marketing automation platform and email marketing service.</li> <li>Matomo: Free and open-source web analytics application for tracking online visits and generating reports.</li> <li>Mautic MA: Open-source marketing automation platform with lead management, campaign management, and email features.</li> <li>Meaning Cloud: Machine learning services for sentiment analysis, language detection, text classification, and more.</li> <li>Microservice: Handles Tracardi plugin microservices for accessing a growing set of services with zero maintenance cost.</li> <li>Mixpanel: Business analytics service for tracking user interactions and measuring engagement and retention.</li> <li>MongoDB: Cross-platform document-oriented database program with JSON-like documents and optional schemas.</li> <li>MQTT: Messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT) that is lightweight and ideal for remote devices.</li> <li>MySQL: Relational database management system based on structured query language (SQL).</li> <li>Novu messaging: Open-source notification infrastructure for developers to send messages to different providers.</li> <li>PostgreSQL: Free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.</li> <li>Pushover: Real-time notification service for Android, iPhone, iPad, Desktop, Android Wear, and Apple Watch.</li> <li>RabbitMq: Connector for RabbitMQ, a message broker that allows distributed data processing outside Tracardi server.</li> <li>Redis: Open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.</li> <li>Salesforce: Cloud-based customer relationship management platform and marketing automation system.</li> <li>Scheduler: Handles scheduled events for delivering messages or performing actions at specific times.</li> <li>SendGrid: Cloud-based SMTP provider for sending emails without maintaining email servers.</li> <li>Sms77: Professional SMS solutions for sending and receiving SMS messages via API, email, or directly in your app.</li> <li>Zapier: Product for integrating web applications and automating workflows.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"qa/bulk/available_extenstions/","title":"What extensions are in Tracardi","text":"<p>List of available Tracardi extensions:</p> <ul> <li>ActiveCampaign</li> <li>Airtable</li> <li>Amplitude</li> <li>AWS IAM</li> <li>Civi CRM</li> <li>ElasticEmail</li> <li>ElasticSearch</li> <li>Full contact</li> <li>HubSpot</li> <li>InfluxDB</li> <li>Mailchimp MA</li> <li>Matomo</li> <li>Mautic MA</li> <li>Meaning Cloud</li> <li>Microservice</li> <li>Mixpanel</li> <li>MongoDB</li> <li>MQTT</li> <li>MySQL</li> <li>Novu messaging</li> <li>PostgreSQL</li> <li>Pushover</li> <li>RabbitMq</li> <li>Redis</li> <li>Salesforce</li> <li>Scheduler</li> <li>SendGrid</li> <li>Sms77</li> <li>Zapier</li> </ul>"},{"location":"qa/bulk/extension_questions/","title":"Can Tracardi use ActiveCampaign ?","text":"<p>Yes.

opens, clicks, sold/not sold, click/open dates, etc.?</p> <p>A: Yes, segmentation can be done in regular Tracardi workflows. You can segment data based on any internal or external data or conditions set within the workflow.</p> <p>Q: How many customer interactions can Tracardi log, including opens, clicks, and sales over the life of the lead?</p> <p>A: Tracardi has been tested to store 10 million events per profile, but the limit ultimately depends on the storage size. Tracardi is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, as evidenced by instances with 0.3 billion events loading in a fraction of a second. The scalability is mainly due to the storage capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p> <p>__Q: Can Tracardi import customer interactions from external email marketing software like Mailwizz? Is it streamed live or can it be scheduled? __</p> <p>A: To import customer interactions from Mailwizz or similar software, you can set up a trigger in the software's table to copy the interaction records to another table. Then, a script can move the copied records to Tracardi using the Tracardi API and remove the duplicated records. This process can be scheduled using cron jobs, Kubernetes jobs, or other scheduling mechanisms. If Mailwizz supports webhooks, real-time importing can be achieved through webhooks. Additionally, you can include pixels in emails for further tracking if required.</p> <p>Q: Can newly added data be analyzed for duplicates or used to enrich current profiles if it's the same lead? Are leads assigned a unique ID?</p> <p>A: Tracardi's main purpose is to maintain a single profile that includes data copied from events or external systems. The profiles are automatically merged and deduplicated at identification points if configured to do so. Tracardi assigns unique IDs to leads, and it also keeps a history of previous IDs. This allows Tracardi to track customers across different devices and merge their profiles.</p> <p>Q: Does Tracardi need to be integrated with a data warehouse tool to store all the data? Are there any recommendations for such integration?</p> <p>A: Tracardi uses Elasticsearch and Kibana for simple analytics, providing a comprehensive overview of individual profiles. However, Tracardi is not designed as an analytical tool for aggregate analysis of all customers. For in-depth analysis, it is recommended to use an external system of your choice. Tracardi can send event data to external systems if necessary, allowing integration with data warehouse tools or other analytical platforms.</p>"},{"location":"qa/bulk/plugins_questions/","title":"Can
