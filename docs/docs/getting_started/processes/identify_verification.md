# Identify verification

**Identity Verification** is a process used to confirm that the customer can verify that the provided data truly belongs
to them. This is essential to ensure that the data associated with the customer is accurate and legitimate, preventing
issues like merging profiles based on incorrect or fraudulent information.

For example, if a customer provides a phone number, we can verify that it is theirs by sending a code via SMS. The
customer must then return this code to the system to confirm that they indeed own the phone number. Similarly, with an
email address, we can send a verification link or code that the customer must click or enter to prove that the email
belongs to them.

These verification processes for phone numbers and emails make them **technical merging keys** because they can be
automatically verified. Once verified, these identifiers can be used to merge profiles confidently, knowing that the
data is accurate.

However, some identifiers, such as a passport number or other personal documents, cannot be **automatically verified**
in the same way. These identifiers can still be used to identify profiles, but they require manual verification to
ensure accuracy. Therefore, they are not considered technical merging keys like phone numbers or emails, which can be
verified through automated processes.
