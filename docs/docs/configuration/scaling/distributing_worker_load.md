# Distributing Worker Load on Different Servers

This documentation provides guidance on using Helm charts to distribute workloads across designated nodes in Kubernetes
by leveraging node affinity settings.

In Kubernetes, **affinity** is a mechanism that allows you to specify rules for scheduling pods on particular nodes
based on custom requirements, such as node labels, to optimize resource allocation and performance.

## Configuration

Each worker and API component has its own dedicated **affinity** section in the `values.yaml` file, allowing you to
define custom affinity rules for scheduling. These sections specify node preferences and requirements, enabling you to
control the distribution of workloads across different nodes based on specific criteria such as node labels, zone, or
instance type.

By configuring affinity settings within each componentâ€™s section, you can ensure that workers, API instances, and other
services are distributed effectively to meet resource and performance needs.

For example:

- The `api.private.nodeAffinity` and `api.public.nodeAffinity` sections control node placement for private and public
  API instances.
- The `worker.background.nodeAffinity`, `worker.collector.nodeAffinity`, and `worker.workflow.nodeAffinity` sections
  allow you to set rules for various worker types.

These configurations make it possible to tailor pod deployment based on node characteristics, helping optimize workload
management across the Kubernetes cluster.

### Affinity-Related Configuration Examples

These are examples for node affinity configuration.

1. **API Private Node Affinity** (`api.private.nodeAffinity`):
   ```yaml
    # Example of nodeAffinity
    api:
      private:
        nodeAffinity:
          required:
            - key: node-type
              operator: In
              values:
                - compute
          preferred:
            - weight: 100
              key: zone
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-east-1a
            - weight: 50
              key: instance-type
              operator: In
              values:
                - c5.xlarge
   ```

2. **API Public Node Affinity** (`api.public.nodeAffinity`):
   ```yaml
    api:
      public:
        nodeAffinity:
          required:
            - key: node-type
              operator: In
              values:
                - compute
          preferred:
            - weight: 100
              key: zone
              operator: In
              values:
                - us-east-1a
            - weight: 50
              key: instance-type
              operator: In
              values:
                - c5.xlarge
   ```
