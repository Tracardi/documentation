# What is the difference between Open-source and CCommercial Tracardi.

Tracardi is a powerful customer journey automation tool that offers both an open-source version for internal use and a
commercial version tailored for business purposes. The commercial version of Tracardi features a different engine that
allows parallel processing of events, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications. In this article, we will
delve into the unique features provided by the commercial version, which are designed to streamline customer engagement
and optimize workflows.

### Unique Features of the Commercial Version

### Parallel Processing

The commercial version of Tracardi offers parallel event processing, enabling it to handle higher traffic volumes
efficiently. This advanced capability ensures that multiple events can be processed simultaneously, significantly
enhancing the system's performance and scalability. Here's how parallel processing benefits enterprise-level
applications:

#### High Throughput

With the ability to process multiple events in parallel, Tracardi can manage a large number of events per second. This
high throughput is essential for businesses dealing with vast amounts of customer interactions, ensuring that no event
is missed or delayed.

#### Improved Performance

Parallel processing reduces the time taken to handle each event, resulting in faster response times. This improved
performance is crucial for real-time customer engagement, where timely interactions can lead to higher customer
satisfaction and conversion rates.

#### Scalability

The commercial version's parallel processing capabilities allow it to scale seamlessly with growing business needs. As
the volume of events increases, Tracardi can efficiently distribute the load across multiple processing units,
maintaining optimal performance without requiring significant infrastructure changes.

#### Streamlined Configuration

The commercial version of Tracardi offers a simplified configuration process, making it effortless to set up and
maintain. With a user-friendly interface, businesses can quickly adapt the tool to their specific requirements, saving
time and effort in the long run.

#### Advanced Time-Based Event Handling

Time-based event handling is crucial for effective customer journey automation. The commercial version enhances this
capability by enabling users to execute processes triggered by specific time intervals. For instance, you can
automatically check if a customer has made a purchase after leaving your page and send personalized follow-up messages,
such as a reminder, 20 minutes later.

#### Expanded Event Collectors

Tracardi’s commercial version provides additional event collectors that can gather data from various sources like Kafka,
RabbitMQ, IMAP, MQTT, and more. This broadens the scope of data collection, allowing businesses to leverage insights
from diverse platforms and systems.

#### Validating, Transforming, and Copying Events

Events collected through Tracardi can undergo validation, transformation, and automatic copying to customer profiles.
This ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and readily accessible for further analysis and action.

#### Intelligent Profile Merging

Profiles within the commercial version of Tracardi are automatically merged based on identification points. Even before
an event reaches the workflow, relevant profile data is consolidated, providing a comprehensive view of each customer’s
journey.

#### Extensive Action Plugins

Tracardi’s commercial version offers an array of action plugins to enhance workflow functionality. Let’s explore a few
examples:

- **Pause and Resume**: Temporarily halt a workflow and resume it after a specified time. Useful for contacting
  customers later, such as sending reminders about abandoned items in their shopping cart or offering time-limited
  discounts.
- **Limiter**: Controls the number of workflow launches within a defined period to prevent overloading and manage
  resource-intensive plugins efficiently.
- **Load Data Report**: Create customized reports focused on customer data, empowering businesses to gain valuable
  insights into purchase trends, customer behavior, and aggregated information.
- **Geo Distance or Geo Fencing**: Trigger location-based actions tailored to a customer’s geographic position, enabling
  geographically targeted marketing campaigns or personalized recommendations.
- **Event Aggregator**: Aggregate and analyze data from specific events to gain deeper insights into customer behavior
  patterns and trends.
- **Event Counter**: Track the number of events in a customer’s history, enabling businesses to identify patterns and
  prioritize actions based on event frequency.
- **Multiple Segmentation Plugins**: Utilize segmentation plugins to remember past segments and apply them in subsequent
  workflows, enabling more sophisticated segmentation algorithms.
- **Event Sequencing Matching**: Identify specific sequences of events in a customer’s history to trigger tailored
  actions, such as detecting interest in a product without making a purchase and prompting personalized follow-up
  offers.

#### Enhanced Data Management

The commercial version enables saving and loading of additional data into the entity’s database. This feature allows
businesses to store supplementary information such as email records, product purchases, and more, enhancing data-driven
decision-making.

#### Intelligent Session Handling

Automatically closes a customer’s session or visit upon leaving your page. This enables the binding of workflows
triggered by a customer’s exit, opening up new possibilities for time-based workflows. Businesses can leverage this
feature to deliver targeted messages or offers based on customer behavior and interaction with their website.

#### Automated Segmentation and Profile Management

Facilitates automated segmentation of customer profiles. Users can schedule segmentation processes to run at specified
intervals, allowing them to move profiles from one segment to another based on profile activity or inactivity.

#### Archiving Inactive Profiles

With the commercial version, businesses can archive inactive profiles. This feature helps declutter the active profile
list and focus on engaged customers. Archiving inactive profiles also helps streamline workflows and maintain a clean
database, ensuring efficient data management.

#### Retroactive Data Processing

Allows businesses to process historical data and copy it to profiles or index event data, even if the events were
collected before the corresponding workflows were created. This capability enables businesses to retroactively leverage
previously collected data, ensuring comprehensive customer data analysis and personalized communication based on
historical information.

#### Enhanced User Experience with UIX Widgets

Offers UIX (User Interface Experience) widgets that enable businesses to inject interactive forms into their customer
journey. These widgets can measure customer satisfaction at specific event touchpoints, such as using a rating widget to
provide feedback on their experience at different stages of their journey. This valuable data helps businesses
understand customer sentiments and improve their overall experience.

### Summary

Tracardi’s commercial version provides an extensive range of features designed to enhance customer journey automation
and streamline business operations. From simplified configuration to advanced time-based event handling, additional
event collectors, and a wide array of action plugins, businesses can harness the power of Tracardi to deliver
personalized, targeted experiences to their customers. With intelligent profile merging, retroactive data processing,
and enhanced user experience through UIX widgets, Tracardi’s commercial version empowers businesses to optimize their
workflows, gain deeper insights into customer behavior, and drive meaningful engagement. By leveraging these enhanced
