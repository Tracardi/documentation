# What is cross domain click?

A cross-domain click refers to a user interaction where a click on one website leads to navigation to a different
domain. This typically occurs when a user clicks a link on Site A that directs them to Site B.

Cross-domain clicks are important in web analytics, advertising, and user experience design. They can present challenges
for tracking user behavior, as browsers implement various restrictions on cross-domain interactions to protect user
privacy.

# What is cross domain event?

A cross-domain event in Tracardi is a mechanism that allows the transfer of a customer's profile ID from one domain to
another, maintaining continuity of customer identification across different owned websites. Here's how it works:

1. Configuration: Enable the feature by adding `trackExternalLinks` to the tracker settings, specifying the domains you
   own.

2. Link Rewriting: The JavaScript code automatically rewrites links on the page, adding `__tr_pid` (profile ID)
   and `__tr_src` (source ID) parameters to URLs that match the specified domains.

3. Profile Transfer: When a user clicks a modified link, these parameters are passed to the destination domain.

4. Profile Recognition: On the new domain, Tracardi checks for these parameters. If found and valid profile is available
   then it merges the referred profile with an existing local profile

5. Session Management: Tracardi invalidates the session if the profile ID is incorrect and creates a new one if
   necessary.

!!! Tip

      The destination web site musts have tracardi connected and tracker.context.tracardiPass set to true.

This approach ensures consistent customer identification across your owned domains, improving user tracking and
analytics capabilities.
