### **Cluster Status Page Metrics**

| **Field**                     | **Example Value** | **Description**                                                                                                                          | **Purpose**                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name of the Cluster**       | `my-cluster`      | The unique name assigned to the cluster.                                                                                                 | Useful for identifying your cluster, especially in multi-cluster environments.                            |
| **Cluster**                   | `abc123`          | The unique ID of the cluster, auto-generated by Elasticsearch.                                                                           | Used internally to distinguish the cluster.                                                               |
| **Status of the Cluster**     | `green`           | The overall health of the cluster: `green`, `yellow`, or `red`.                                                                          | Indicates the availability of shards and overall cluster health.                                          |
| **Timed Out**                 | `false`           | Whether the request to check the cluster status timed out.                                                                               | A `true` value may suggest connectivity or performance issues.                                            |
| **Number of Nodes**           | `5`               | The total number of nodes in the cluster, including master-eligible, data, and coordinating-only nodes.                                  | Helps ensure all expected nodes are part of the cluster.                                                  |
| **Number of Data Nodes**      | `4`               | The number of nodes that store data and handle search and indexing operations.                                                           | Indicates the actual capacity for data storage and queries.                                               |
| **Active Primary Shards**     | `122`             | The number of primary shards that are active.                                                                                            | Ensures data availability, as primary shards are necessary for indexing and querying.                     |
| **Active Shards**             | `245`             | The total number of active shards, including primary and replica shards.                                                                 | A high number indicates proper allocation; mismatches may point to problems.                              |
| **Relocating Shards**         | `0`               | The number of shards being moved between nodes.                                                                                          | Persistent relocations can indicate rebalancing or node failure recovery.                                 |
| **Initializing Shards**       | `0`               | The number of shards currently being initialized (e.g., during recovery or index creation).                                              | Persistent initialization suggests recovery or resource issues.                                           |
| **Unassigned Shards**         | `0`               | The number of shards that are not assigned to any node.                                                                                  | A non-zero value can indicate insufficient resources, node failures, or allocation constraints.           |
| **Delayed Unassigned Shards** | `0`               | The number of unassigned shards for which allocation has been delayed due to settings like `index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout`. | Identifies shards waiting for reallocation due to node failures or planned maintenance.                   |
| **Number of Pending Tasks**   | `0`               | The number of tasks waiting in the clusterâ€™s task queue (e.g., shard allocation, mapping updates).                                       | A high number of pending tasks may indicate bottlenecks or cluster strain.                                |
| **In-Flight Fetches**         | `0`               | The number of shard-level requests currently being fetched (e.g., during search operations).                                             | High numbers may suggest a busy cluster or slow shard responses.                                          |
| **Active Shards Percentage**  | `100.00%`         | The percentage of shards that are active compared to the total number of shards.                                                         | A value less than 100% indicates unassigned or initializing shards, potentially impacting cluster health. |

### **What Do the Cluster Status Colors Mean?**

| **Status** | **Meaning**                                                                        | **Action Required**                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Green**  | All primary and replica shards are assigned, and the cluster is fully operational. | No action needed.                                                                  |
| **Yellow** | All primary shards are assigned, but some replica shards are unassigned.           | Check the allocation and resources to resolve unassigned replicas.                 |
| **Red**    | Some primary shards are unassigned, meaning data is unavailable or lost.           | Immediate action required to recover primary shards and restore data availability. |

### **How to Use These Metrics**

1. **Monitor Cluster Health:**
    - Regularly check the `status` and `active shards percentage` to ensure the cluster is fully operational.

2. **Diagnose Issues:**
    - If the cluster is `yellow` or `red`, investigate unassigned shards, pending tasks, and in-flight fetches.

3. **Plan Scaling:**
    - Use metrics like `number of nodes`, `data nodes`, and `active shards` to monitor resource usage and determine if
      scaling is necessary.

4. **Optimize Recovery:**
    - Watch for `relocating shards` and `initializing shards` during recovery or rebalancing operations.
